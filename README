## xdg-user-dirs-gtk

__xdg-user-dirs-gtk__ is a companion to [xdg-user-dirs](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/) that seamlessly integrates it into the GNOME desktop and Gtk+ applications.

During the login process, xdg-user-dirs-gtk performs two crucial tasks:

1. **Tracking Locale Changes**: It monitors any changes in the user's locale settings and, when necessary, prompts the user to modify their directories accordingly. This ensures that the directory names align correctly with the user's chosen language and regional preferences.

2. **Creating Default Gtk Bookmarks**: In cases where there is no existing Gtk bookmarks file, xdg-user-dirs-gtk generates a default file for the user. This file is based on a predefined set of xdg user directories, ensuring consistent and organized access to essential user folders in Gtk+ applications.
